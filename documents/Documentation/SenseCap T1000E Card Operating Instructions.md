# SenseCap T1000E Card Operating Instructions

When you first power on after the update, the card will come up and the LED should be solid green.
It will be running in **FANET mode**, and the aircraft type is preset to **Paraglider**.  
The solid green LED means the battery power is good, and the device is **NOT airborne**.
